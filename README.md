# Dots-And-Boxes



Project: Dots And Boxes
Submitters: Shuhang Xue, Yilun Liu
Project type: Interactive game between the user and computer intelligence

Rule of the game:

There is no extra files needed to run this program. There is no known bugs or issues with the program. 

  This game is played on a board consisting of sixteen evenly spread dots. There are four dots on one line and there are four
lines. The user makes the first move by drawing (in our design it is by entering a number that correspond to that line) a line between any two dots,
horizontally or vertically. Then the computer will make the next possible move. The user and the computer take turns until all the possible lines
have been drawn. At that time, the program will calculate the number of squares each side drew and determine the winner. There are a total of nine
squares by the end of the game, so there will not be a tie.

  Interestingly, by scoring a square, one side does not need to draw all four lines oneself. He only need to complete the last line. That being said,
if the previous three lines are drawn by the opponent and the fourth line is drawn by me, then the square still belongs to me and my score increases by one.
Therefore, it is a good advice to play that finishing, scoring move and try not to give your opponent these scoring moves.
        
The letter 'A' represents the user and the letter 'B' represents the computer. In the real execution or Google demo, you will get a visual sense of how the game runs and performs. The dashed lines are all possible moves, and once a dash line is filled with a letter, you can no longer play that move.
